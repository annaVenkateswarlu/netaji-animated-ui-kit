## 🎨 Animation Themes

Each theme represents a different style and visual effect:

| Theme              | Description                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Interactive Particles** | Dynamic particle effects that respond to cursor movement |
| **Geometric Patterns**   | Hypnotic, CSS-drawn geometric designs        |
| **Starlit Sky**          | Twinkling night sky with floating stars      |
| **Space Journey**        | Cosmic arrows and shooting stars             |
